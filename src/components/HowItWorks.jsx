      Hosting The Elf Shelf<span className="sup">&reg;</span> Holiday Shop is fun!

And because you receive a complete program from The Elf Shelf<span className="sup">&reg;</span> with promotion items, supplies, a cash register, quality gifts, a no inventory process, and free shipping, itâ€™s MUCH easier than trying to do it all on your own.  Everything is sent on consignment, so there is no prepayment, and groups  pay for only the gifts that sold AFTER the sale is over.</p>
