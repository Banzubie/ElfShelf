      Elf Shelf® Holiday Shop gifts are selected by a team of purchasers during a two-week trip to China every January. After a variety of gifts are selected, SchoolPals (the parent company of Elf Shelf® Holiday Shop) participates in a process to discuss which gifts should be chosen.  The selected gifts then go through an independent testing process. All Elf Shelf® Holiday Shop gifts must pass quality control and the Federal CPSIA testing requirements to be included in our gift line. Test results are available upon request.

100% Gift Guarantee – If at any time a gift is damaged, simply contact us and a replacement will be shipped directly to the purchaser free of charge.  No questions asked!
